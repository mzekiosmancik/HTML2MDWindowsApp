# HTML2MDWindowsApp
This is the basic HTML to Markdown converter that I made for a simple Wiki Pages conversion, so we can use the Azure Wiki system.

I used HtmlAgilityPack and ReverseMarkdown  libraries for make it faster. 

Basically you pick a folder with bunch of html files then it detects the count then convert button converts all html files into C:/WikiFiles Folder in your C drive.
